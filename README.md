# PathJS

PathJS is a lightweight, client-side routing library that allows you to create "single page" applications using Hashbangs and/or HTML5 pushState.

This repository was forked from [mtrpcic/pathjs](https://github.com/mtrpcic/pathjs) for continued maintenance. The latest version in this repository still serves as a drop in replacement for the original version.

# Getting Started

Description forthcoming.
Visit [mtrpcic/pathjs](https://github.com/mtrpcic/pathjs) in the meantime. The API is still the same.

Additionally it also exposes itself as an AMD module (named 'path') if a module loader like [require.js](http://requirejs.org) is present.
